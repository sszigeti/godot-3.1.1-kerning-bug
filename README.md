This project is for exposing a bug in [Godot Engine 3.1.1](https://godotengine.org/), which causes the usage of incorrect kerning data of a dynamic font.

The font used for demonstrating the problem is [Herr Von Muellerhoff](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Herr+Von+Muellerhoff), but as it is rendered correctly both in Photoshop and on its home page at Google Fonts by the browser, it suggests the font itself is fine.
